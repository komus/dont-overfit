# Don't Overfit

One of the main objectives of predictive modelling is to build a model that will give accurate predictions on unseen data.

A necessary step in the building of models is to ensure that they have not overfit the training data, which leads to sub optimal predictions on new data.

The purpose of this challenge is to stimulate research and highlight existing algorithms, techniques or strategies that can be used to guard against overfitting.
